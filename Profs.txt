Professions:
Receive two Prof Points upon character creation, afterwards receive +1 in a profession chosen as one's primary every odd character level. Starting at level 2, points in weapon skills may be used to level up professions. Professions have skill/perk trees, with some perks ("special knowledge") only unlockable via special events, Dreams, books, or quests and may require a prerequisite, even in other trees, otherwise a party member may assist in unlocking them.
**Lore
  *beneficial for everyone, but mages most of all 
  *increases chance of successful Dream
  *has a Language branch
**Gunsmith (highly recommended for firearm specialists, e.g. can make own bullets from bars)
  *Allows you to become increasingly more independent from NPCs who would otherwise supply you or maintain your firearms
  *Later perks, as well as Special Knowledge, allows you to innovate
**Alchemy
  *a party needs someone who's a primary alchemist, as I have a lot of interesting ideas for it :)
  *alchemy is the main branch, but things like first aid, while favourable, are optional
  *in terms of special knowledge, synergises with other Profs almost as well as Lore does
  *a late game alchemist is a lot like a witcher, minus the harsh rites of passage
**Hunting
  *Only available to Hunters
  *Since this is a mandatory primary prof, in a sense, it makes the Hunter more special, but in another sense, it also balances/gimps the class, since it has little Special Knowledge and perk points in general. However, that doesn't stop it from being very, very useful.
  *The main branch, quite unintuitively, focuses on controlling the falcon rather than actual hunting. 


*after prof lvl 5? a Dream roll is done regardless of lore level, but levels in lore and extra levels in prof give better chances
