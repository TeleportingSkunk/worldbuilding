The lore behind dreaming
Everybody sleeps, everybody sees dreams. However, for as long as there have been people, there were a few who have a special connection with the Summer Sun. Every so often in their sleep, they would dream of real things never before seen, and even meet real people who just like them were dreaming. Such dreams are particularly vivid, in a way even real, and the dreamer has better control of themselves. Described differently by different cultures, and seen often as both a blessing and a curse, as experiencing the dream, at best, meant a not-so restful night. Anecdotally, Dreaming is also semi-contagious.
